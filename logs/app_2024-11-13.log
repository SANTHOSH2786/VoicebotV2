2024-11-13 22:54:18 [INFO]: AI Response: This code sets up a Node.js server using Express framework to handle chat requests and file uploads. It configures middleware such as body parser, multer for file uploads, and logging with Winston. The server listens on a specified port (default 4000) and serves an HTML file at the root URL.

The server checks for the presence of an OpenAI API key in the environment variables and exits if it is missing. It creates a logs directory and logs API requests and responses to a file.

The server uses multer to accept specific file types (CSV, TXT, JSON, XLSX) for uploads. It processes the uploaded files based on their type and content. If a query is also provided, it sends both the query and file content to the OpenAI API for a response.

The response from the OpenAI API, along with additional information like response time and tokens used, is sent back to the client. Error handling is implemented for various scenarios, such as missing API key, file processing errors, and network errors.

The server logs information about the AI response, response time, and tokens used, and provides detailed error messages in case of failures. It starts listening on the specified port and logs a message indicating the server is running.

2024-11-13 22:56:10 [INFO]: AI Response: To add a microphone icon for voice input in your application, you can add an HTML element for the microphone icon and implement voice input functionality using the Web Speech API. Here's how you can modify your existing code to include the microphone icon and voice input functionality:

1. Add the following HTML code to your `index.html` file to include the microphone icon:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Voice Input Chat</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="voice-input-container">
        <i id="microphone-icon" class="fas fa-microphone"></i>
    </div>
    <script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/a076d05399.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Make sure to include Font Awesome library to use the microphone icon (You can replace the class `fas fa-microphone` with the appropriate Font Awesome class if needed).

2. Update your server-side code to handle voice input from the client:

```javascript
const SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;
const recognition = new SpeechRecognition();

recognition.onstart = () => {
    console.log('Voice recognition started');
};

recognition.onerror = (event) => {
    console.error('Voice recognition error:', event.error);
};

recognition.onresult = (event) => {
    const transcript = event.results[0][0].transcript;
    console.log('Voice input:', transcript);
    
    // Process the voice input
    processQueryAndRespond(transcript, null, res);
};

// Listen for voice input when the microphone icon is clicked
document.getElementById('microphone-icon').addEventListener('click', () => {
    recognition.start();
});
```

In this code snippet, we create a `SpeechRecognition` object to handle voice input. When the microphone icon is clicked, we start voice recognition. The `onresult` event is triggered when speech recognition recognizes speech, and we process the voice input by calling the `processQueryAndRespond` function.

With these modifications, users can now click on the microphone icon to provide voice inputs to your application. The voice inputs will be processed and responded to based on the functionality in your `processQueryAndRespond` function.

2024-11-13 23:15:07 [INFO]: AI Response: Hanuman is a powerful and beloved figure in Hindu mythology. He is known for his unwavering devotion and incredible strength. Here is the story of Hanuman:

Hanuman was born to Anjana and Kesari, two divine beings in the form of a monkey and a vanara (a race of monkey-like beings) respectively. He was blessed with incredible strength, agility, and intelligence from birth. As a child, Hanuman was mischievous and playful, often disrupting the peace of the forest where he lived.

One day, Hanuman mistook the sun for a ripe mango and flew up to eat it. To teach him a lesson, the gods struck him with a lightning bolt, which injured his jaw. However, instead of being discouraged, Hanuman continued to grow stronger and more devoted to Lord Rama, an avatar of the god Vishnu.

When Lord Rama's wife, Sita, was kidnapped by the demon king Ravana, Hanuman volunteered to help find her. He leaped across the ocean to the island of Lanka, where Ravana had taken Sita. There, he found her imprisoned in a grove of ashoka trees and delivered Lord Rama's message of hope and reassurance.

In order to prove his loyalty to Lord Rama and rescue Sita, Hanuman set fire to Lanka using his tail. He then returned to Lord Rama's side and helped defeat Ravana in a fierce battle.

After the victory, Hanuman continued to serve Lord Rama and became one of his most trusted companions. He is often depicted as a symbol of devotion, courage, and selflessness.

Today, Hanuman is worshipped by millions of Hindus around the world. His story inspires countless individuals to overcome obstacles with strength, courage, and unwavering faith. Hanuman's devotion to Lord Rama and his selfless actions make him a revered figure in Hindu mythology.

2024-11-13 23:17:49 [INFO]: AI Response: There once was a young woman named Emily who lived in a small village on the outskirts of a dense forest. Emily was known in the village for her kindness and generosity, always helping those in need and looking out for her neighbors.

One day, a fierce storm swept through the village, causing widespread damage and leaving many people homeless. Emily immediately sprang into action, organizing a relief effort and working tirelessly to help those affected by the storm. She spent hours clearing debris, providing food and shelter for those in need, and offering words of comfort and support to those who had lost everything.

As the days turned into weeks, the village slowly began to recover from the storm, thanks in large part to Emily's selfless efforts. The villagers were in awe of her strength and determination, and they gathered to express their gratitude and admiration for her.

But Emily was humble and simply smiled, grateful that she could make a difference in the lives of those around her. The village had a newfound sense of community and unity, all thanks to the kindness and compassion of one young woman named Emily. And from that day on, she was known as the hero of the village, a beacon of hope and inspiration for all who knew her.

2024-11-13 23:18:30 [INFO]: AI Response: Once upon a time in a small village nestled in the mountains, there lived a young girl named Isobel. She was known throughout the village for her kind heart and adventurous spirit. Isobel loved exploring the forests and meadows that surrounded her home, always seeking out new adventures.

One day, while out on a walk in the woods, Isobel stumbled upon a mysterious cave hidden behind a waterfall. Curiosity getting the best of her, she decided to venture inside. As she made her way through the narrow passageways and dimly lit tunnels, Isobel could hear the sound of rushing water echoing all around her.

After what seemed like hours of wandering, Isobel emerged into a large cavern filled with shimmering crystals and sparkling pools of water. But what caught her eye the most was a magnificent golden statue of a dragon perched on a rock in the center of the cave.

Mesmerized by its beauty, Isobel reached out to touch the statue, and to her surprise, it came to life! The dragon opened its eyes and spoke to her in a booming voice. "You have awakened me, young one. I am the guardian of this cave, and only the pure of heart may pass through."

Isobel was stunned but unafraid. She knew in her heart that she was meant to be there. The dragon could sense her bravery and kindness and offered her a gift - a magical crystal that would bring prosperity and peace to her village.

Gratefully accepting the crystal, Isobel made her way back to the village, where she shared her incredible story with the other villagers. They were in awe of her bravery and the magical gift she had received.

From that day on, Isobel was hailed as a hero in the village, known far and wide for her courage and compassion. And every time she looked at the crystal, she was reminded of the amazing adventures that awaited those who dared to follow their hearts.

2024-11-13 23:23:03 [INFO]: AI Response: The Ramayana is an ancient Indian epic that tells the story of Prince Rama and his quest to rescue his wife, Sita, from the demon king Ravana. The epic is divided into seven books, called kandas, and is attributed to the sage Valmiki.

The story begins with the birth of Rama, the eldest prince of Ayodhya, to King Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya. Rama is praised for his virtues and righteousness, and is favored by his father to become the next king of Ayodhya. However, his stepmother, Kaikeyi, schemes to have her own son, Bharata, crowned king and Rama exiled from the kingdom for fourteen years.

Rama willingly accepts his exile and is accompanied by his loyal wife Sita and his half-brother Lakshmana. During their exile, Sita is kidnapped by the demon king Ravana and taken to his kingdom of Lanka. Rama enlists the help of the monkey king Sugriva and his army of monkeys, including Hanuman, to rescue Sita.

After a fierce battle, Rama defeats Ravana and rescues Sita. However, his victory is short-lived as doubts about Sita's purity arise due to her time in Ravana's captivity. Sita undergoes a trial by fire to prove her innocence and emerges unscathed, reaffirming her chastity.

Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana return to Ayodhya after their exile, where Rama is crowned king and rules with justice and compassion. However, Sita's exile is ordered once again due to rumors questioning her purity. Heartbroken, Sita leaves the kingdom and gives birth to twins, Lava and Kusha, in the forest.

The twins are raised in the forest and grow up to be skilled warriors and singers. Eventually, they come to Ayodhya and sing the story of Rama, revealing themselves to be his sons. Rama is reunited with Sita, but their joy is short-lived as Sita decides to return to the earth, her mother, rather than endure further doubt and criticism.

Rama is grief-stricken at losing Sita, but he rules Ayodhya wisely and justly until the end of his days. He is revered as an ideal king, embodying virtues of righteousness, duty, and sacrifice. The Ramayana is considered one of the greatest epics of Indian literature, teaching valuable lessons about honor, duty, love, and the consequences of one's actions.

పూర్తిగా ఉద్యోగం నడిచే
నా దృష్టి వలె పరలోనే
స్వప్నాలను నిమిషంలో దక్కుకునే

ముందుకు పోవడం ఎంత కష్టం
కాని విజయం తరిమిన సాహసం
నా హృదయంలో తనిచే నీ మార్గం
నుండే ప్రేరణ పదాలు ఇస్తును

నా చిత్రమయం జీవితం నాటే
సంవేదనల కళా నాడే
చేసిన ప్రతిబింబాలు చిత్రిస్తునే
నా కవితలు చాలా మరియు కాదు.
